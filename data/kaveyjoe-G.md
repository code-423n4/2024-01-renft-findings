## [G-01] delete optimization
Use delete instead of set to default value (false or 0).

5 gas could be saved per entry in the following affected lines:

## [G-02] - Using bools for storage incurs overhead

Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

## [G-03] - NO NEED TO EXPLICITLY INITIALIZE VARIABLES WITH DEFAULT VALUES


Since the default value is already zero, overwriting is not required.
Saves 8 gas per instance.

## [G -04] - Using uints/ints smaller than 256 bits increases overhead

Gas usage becomes higher with uint/int smaller than 256 bits because EVM operates on 32 bytes and uses additional operations to reduce the size from 32 bytes to the target size.

## [G-05] Consider marking onlyOwner functions as payable

This one is a bit questionable, but you can try that out. So, the compiler adds some extra conditions in case of non-payable, but we know that onlyOwner modifier will be reverted, if the user invoke following methods.
