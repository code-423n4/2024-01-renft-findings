## a) Overview of the reNFT Project

**reNFT** is a blockchain protocol designed for renting Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It's structured to facilitate the renting process for NFT owners and renters, offering a secure and user-friendly platform.

### Key Features:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate contracts handle specific functions like payment escrow and storage.
2. **Integrations**: Incorporates Seaport for order processing and Gnosis Safe for wallet management.
3. **Security Focus**: Prioritizes the safety of rented assets and secure transaction handling.
4. **Efficient Rental Process**: Manages the rental lifecycle effectively.
5. **Access Control**: Implements role-based access for operational security.
6. **Token Support**: Compatible with ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens.



## b) The approach I would follow when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.

Accordingly, I would analyze and audit the subject in the following steps;

| Number |Stage |Details|Information|
|:--|:----------------|:------|:------|
|1|Compile and Run Test|[Installation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-renft?tab=readme-ov-file#tests)|Test and installation structure is simple, cleanly designed|
|2|Architecture Review| [ReNFT](https://github.com/re-nft/smart-contracts) |Provides a basic architectural teaching for General Architecture|
|3|Graphical Analysis  |Graphical Analysis with [Solidity-metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics)|A visual view has been made to dominate the general structure of the codes of the project.|
|4|Slither Analysis  | [Slither Report](https://github.com/crytic/slither)| Slither report of the project for some basic analysis|
|5|Test Suits|[Tests](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-renft?tab=readme-ov-file#tests)|In this section, the scope and content of the tests of the project are analyzed.|
|6|Manuel Code Review|[Scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-renft?tab=readme-ov-file#scope)||
|7|Using Solodit for common vulnerabilities|[Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/)|Using solodit to find common vulnerabilites related to NFT protocol|
|8|Infographic|[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)|Tried to make Visual drawings to understand the hard-to-understand mechanisms|
|9|Special focus on Areas of  Concern|[Areas of Concern](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-renft?tab=readme-ov-file#attack-ideas-where-to-look-for-bugs)|Code where I should focus more|

## c) Analysis of the code base

The most important summary in analyzing the code base is the stacking of codes to be analyzed.
In this way, many predictions can be made, including the difficulty levels of the contracts, which one is more important for the auditor, the features they contain that are important for security (payable functions, uses assembly, etc.), the audit cost of the project, and the time to be allocated to the audit;
Uses Consensys Solidity Metrics

-  **Language:** language in which of the source is written
-  **nSLOC:** normalized source lines of code (only source-code lines; no comments, no blank lines)
-  **Comment Lines:** lines containing single or block comments
-  **Blank Lines:** Blank Lines in the source file
-  **Total Lines:** Total number of lines in the file

## Comment-to-Source Ratio:

**Module contracts:** On average there are **0.8** code lines per comment (lower=better).

**Packages contracts:** On average there are **1.27** code lines per comment (lower=better).

**Policies contracts:** On average there are **1.35** code lines per comment (lower=better).
