1)Handling errors in _safeTransfer:
Ensure that the _safeTransfer function handles the case where the transfer fails without providing data. You can add an additional check to detect whether the transaction was successful without relying on return data.

(bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
    abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value)
);

if (!success) {
    revert Errors.PaymentEscrowModule_PaymentTransferFailed(token, to, value);
}

// Add a check for data.length to handle cases where the token reverts without providing data.
if (data.length > 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool))) {
    revert Errors.PaymentEscrowModule_PaymentTransferFailed(token, to, value);
}

2)Verifying the contract address in _safeTransfer:
Consider adding a check to ensure that the recipient (to) is a valid contract address before performing the transfer. This helps prevent potential errors in the destination of the transfer.

require(Address.isContract(to), "PaymentEscrow: Invalid contract address");

LOW
1)Explicit internal Visibility:
While Solidity treats functions as internal by default, it might be clearer to explicitly mark internal functions as internal.

2)Use of delete Keyword:
The delete keyword in Solidity is used to reset the state of a storage variable to its default value, and it may result in gas refunds. However, the use of delete can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially when used with dynamic arrays or mappings. When you delete a mapping entry, the gas refund might not be as expected, and it might not completely free up the space in some cases.
Instead of using delete, you may consider setting the variable to its default value manually. For example, if orders is a boolean mapping, you can set it to false:

orders[orderHash] = false;
