# [G-01] Gas requirement of function PaymentEscrow.settlePayment is infinite.

# Impact

0. Gas requirement of function PaymentEscrow.settlePayment is infinite: If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage)
Pos: 320:4.

1. Transaction Failures: The function PaymentEscrow.settlePayment will consistently fail to execute due to exceeding the block gas limit, preventing payments from being settled.

2. User Experience Degradation: Users will encounter errors and delays when attempting to settle payments, leading to frustration and potential loss of trust in the system.

3. System Vulnerability: Potential for attackers to exploit the infinite gas cost to stall the system or prevent legitimate transactions from occurring.

# POC
1. Deploy a contract instance: Deploy the contract with the problematic function to a test network.

2. Trigger the function: Attempt to call the settlePayment function with various input parameters.

3. Observe gas consumption: Monitor the gas consumption of the function execution using a block explorer or development tools.

4. Confirm infinite gas requirement: Verify that the gas consumption steadily increases without reaching a finite limit, indicating an infinite loop or excessive storage modification.

# Mitigation
1. Identify and Refactor Loops: Inspect the _settlePayment function and any functions it calls to locate loops that might not have proper termination conditions. Implement appropriate loop control structures to ensure finite execution.

2. Optimize Storage Operations: Analyze storage usage within the function and identify areas where large arrays are being cleared or copied. Explore alternative approaches that minimize storage modifications, such as:
Using mapping data structures instead of arrays when appropriate.
Updating individual elements instead of clearing and repopulating entire arrays.
Storing calculated values instead of recomputing them on each function call.
